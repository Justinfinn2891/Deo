In this assignment we learned about the Doxygen tool to help comment and document our code.
I spent the majority of the time in this assingment figuring out how to use this tool and have it
work with my linux terminal on my desktop. Finally, I managed to get all the features working and commented
all the files, classes, and functions that I needed to complete.
